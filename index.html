        <h3>Vanderbilt University is celebrating Open Access Week 2017!</h3>
        <p>The theme for Open Access Week 2017 is “Open in order to: __________.” In keeping with this theme, the Vanderbilt University Jean &amp; Alexander Heard Library, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vidl/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt Institute for Digital Learning (VIDL)</a>, the Office of the Associate Provost for Digital Learning, and the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu//digitalhumanities/" target="_blank">Center for Digital Humanities</a>, is inviting speakers and holding events that are demonstrative of the core principal of the University’s current strategic plan, which states that “Vanderbilt University aspires to shape the future of higher education and to foster the creation of knowledge that together improve the human condition.” Events will focus on bridging the information inequity gap through the creation and dissemination of Open Educational Resources and open textbooks, encouraging early career researchers to publish openly, and providing guidance on contributing to and using the largest collection of rights-free material, Wikipedia. </p> <p><strong>Vanderbilt University is open in order to: Bridge the information inequity gap to improve the human condition.</strong></p>

                  <td>Kelly Doyle is the Wikipedian in Residence for Gender Equity at West Virginia University. In this role, Doyle works to raise awareness about the editor and content based gender gap on Wikipedia and helps bridge the gap between Wikipedians, academics, and students. Kelly has organized and hosted several edit-a-thons and lectures about her work and engagement with Wikipedia, including a gender based violence roundtable about online harassment at the Department of State, Office of Global Women’s Issues, the BBC’s annual 100 Women edit-a-thon in Washington D.C., and with the Women’s Media Center. During her time at WVU, Kelly has successfully piloted a service learning program with sororities on campus in an effort to close the gender gap on Wikipedia that will be replicated in the 2017-2018 academic year at three other universities. By advocating for both the use and participation on Wikipedia among women, Kelly is a leader in finding gender based solutions to Wikipedia’s gender gap on college campuses. <p>During her presentation, Doyle will discuss editing the world’s largest source of Open Access materials, with particular attention paid to pages about women whose achievements are often overlooked.</p> </td>
